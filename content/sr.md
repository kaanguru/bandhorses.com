## Sustainability 🌲

### Ethereum is moving towards being secured by staking <small class="text-muted">not computing power</small>

Although staking has already been introduced by the Beacon Chain, the Ethereum we use today will run in parallel for a period of time. One system secured by ETH, the other by computing power. This is until The Merge.

With the Beacon Chain up and running, work has begun on merging Mainnet with the new consensus layer. Mainnet will then be secured by staked ETH and far less energy intensive.

#### Benefits of staking to Ethereum

Staking is **More sustainable** 🌲 Validators don’t need energy-intensive computers in order to participate in a proof-of-stake system – just a laptop or smartphone. This will make Ethereum better for the environment.
