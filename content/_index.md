        <p class="p-2">BandHorses are NOT just an image. Remember that tapping? Exactly! They are a fusion of generative musical phrases 🎵 & visual art 🎨</p>
        <p class="p-2">One of their unique traits turned out to be a 16 beats loop of a musical phrase. These AI-generated Midi loops are just motifs and patterns. All we have to do is just catch the Muse and compose in whatever genre we like.</p>
        <p class="p-2">BandHorses have 12 hand-drawn traits, 65 famous drummers, 101 labels and musician tattoos, and running speeds. It makes each one of them extraordinary. But content over form, right? Remember their unique feature? Yep, musical phrases. That's what makes them stand out from regular profile pictures.</p>
