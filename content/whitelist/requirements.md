## Early access to Band Horses NFT sale

 We create the most exclusive and private club for our members, who will have access to the first Band Horses NFTs. We cheery pick our frenz who access the Whitelist and meet the requirements.

## What Are The Benefits Of Whitelisting?

* **Guaranteed Minting Opportunity**
  * Many people cannot mint because the project has already sold out. Whitelisters have chances to mint the NFT without the need to indulge in a scrum with a mass of people.
* **The Opportunity To Mint For A Lower Price**
  * **Whitelist** sale price is: 0.008 ETH
  * **Public sale** price will be 0.01 ETH
* **Lowest gas prices**
  * The gas fee is determined by demand, and if many wish to carry out a transaction at any particular time, it invariably leads to high gas prices.

## How to get listed?

* Be Early
