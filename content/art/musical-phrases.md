Holders will have seamless looping, 16 beats of unique musical phrases by having a BandHorse friend.
Musical phrases are just motifs and patterns. Loops are not full compositions. They have more use cases. They can be used in combination with different musical genres.

Bandhorses has unique building blocks for music which can be used in rock, pop, jazz, or metal tracks completely royalty-free.

* Holders get full usage rights that are not restricted by time, location, or medium.
* BandHorses has tagged mp4 files. Sound files are labeled with information such as tempo and horse id.
* They are all stored on the blockchain forever using IPFS.

Modify midi files to match your production. We will have necessary tutorial videos explaining how to use loops in your musical productions.

**10 different Tempos** Including Lossless FLAC, Ogg, and midi files enable future implementations we canâ€™t envision today.
