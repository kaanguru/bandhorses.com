## What about metadata?

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-6">

All info is in the official non-fungible tokens metadata standard of Ethereum. And all side-chain files like Ogg and midi files are well tagged for a better organization and uploaded to the interplanetary file system for redundancy. They include tempo, performer horse id, and even midi channel info.
