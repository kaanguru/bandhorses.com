question = "Are Band Horses Rug Pull Protected? 💸"
answer = "Band Horses media files are stored on IPFS with a proxy on <a href='https://www.pinata.cloud/' target='_blank'> pinata.cloud </a> ☁️ </br> IPFS solves this potentially catastrophic problem thanks to its use of content addressing. Adding data to IPFS produces a content identifier (CID) that is directly derived from the data itself, and links to the data in the IPFS network. Because a CID can only ever refer to one piece of content, we know that nobody can replace or alter the content without breaking the link </br>Using that CID, anyone can fetch a copy of its data from the IPFS network as long as at least one copy exists on the network — even if the original provider has disappeared. This makes CIDs perfect for NFT storage."

question = "What is a dApp?"
answer = "A decentralized application, or dApp, is one that runs on a distributed peer to peer network rather than from a central server. </br> In the context of blockchain, a dApp uses smart contracts and possibly a P2P network, instead of a Web API service. A dApp may also expose a front end and cache information from the blockchain temporarily, but its output is ultimately reflected on-chain."
